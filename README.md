# Nano-GPT

This repository contains code and resources for my personal learning project, inspired by and following the tutorial titled "Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out." The tutorial is conducted by Andrej Karpathy and is available on YouTube.

## About the Project

Nano-GPT is a learning project where I explore the intricacies of building a GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model from scratch. The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and mechanisms of GPT models.

## Tutorial Reference

The tutorial I am following can be found here: [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy).

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I aim to achieve the following learning outcomes:

- Understanding the architecture of GPT models.
- Implementing the model in Python.
- Grasping the training and fine-tuning processes of language models.

## How to Use This Repository
